# Bank Customer Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank customer data to gain insights into customer behavior, account activity, and financial metrics. Using SQL, we performed various queries to explore trends and correlations within the dataset.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

- CustomerId: Unique identifier for each customer

- Surname: Customer's last name

- CreditScore: Customer's credit score

- Geography: Customer's country

- Gender: Customer's gender

- Age: Customer's age

- Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank

- Balance: Customer's account balance

- NumOfProducts: Number of products the customer holds with the bank

- HasCrCard: Indicates whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

- IsActiveMember: Indicates whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

- EstimatedSalary: Customer's estimated salary

- Exited: Indicates whether the customer has exited the bank (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

## Objectives

1. Identify customers from specific geographies who hold multiple products and analyze their trends.

2. Determine the geographic regions with the highest total account balances.

3. Investigate how customer tenure influences the likelihood of owning a credit card across different geographies.

4. Explore the correlation between the number of products held and credit scores, segmented by age groups.

5. Assess how being an active member impacts account balance and how this varies by gender.

6. Examine the relationship between estimated salaries and the number of products held, considering the impact of customer tenure.

These analyses provide valuable insights into customer dynamics, helping to inform strategic decisions and improve customer engagement and retention.
