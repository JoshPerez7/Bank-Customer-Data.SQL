# Bank Customer Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank customer data to gain insights into customer behavior, account activity, and financial metrics. Using SQL, we performed various queries to explore trends and correlations within the dataset.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

- CustomerId: Unique identifier for each customer

- Surname: Customer's last name

- CreditScore: Customer's credit score

- Geography: Customer's country

- Gender: Customer's gender

- Age: Customer's age

- Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank

- Balance: Customer's account balance

- NumOfProducts: Number of products the customer holds with the bank

- HasCrCard: Indicates whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

- IsActiveMember: Indicates whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

- EstimatedSalary: Customer's estimated salary

- Exited: Indicates whether the customer has exited the bank (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

## Objectives

1. Identify customers from France who hold multiple products.

2. Determine the geographic regions with the highest total account balances.

3. Investigate how customer tenure influences the likelihood of owning a credit card across different geographies.

4. Explore the correlation between the number of products held and credit scores, segmented by age groups.

5. Assess how being an active member impacts account balance and how this varies by gender.

6. Examine the relationship between estimated salaries and the number of products held, considering the impact of customer tenure.

These analyses provide valuable insights into customer dynamics, helping to inform strategic decisions and improve customer engagement and retention.

## Results and Insights

1. This query identified customers in France who hold more than one product. These customers are potentially more engaged with the bank's offerings, making them ideal candidates for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized service enhancements.

2. The results showed which geographic regions have the highest total account balances. This information is valuable for strategic resource allocation and targeted investment in regions with higher financial activity.

3. This analysis revealed how customer tenure influences the likelihood of owning a credit card across different geographies. Understanding these trends helps the bank design tenure-specific incentives and credit card promotions.

4. The query demonstrated the correlation between the number of products held and credit scores, segmented by age groups. These insights are useful for developing age-specific product offerings and credit policies.

5. This analysis showed that active membership status impacts account balances differently across genders. The bank can leverage this information to tailor engagement programs that increase account activity among different gender groups.

6. The results highlighted how estimated salaries correlate with the number of products held by customers, taking their tenure into account. These findings help in designing salary-based product bundles and tenure-specific promotions.

## Conclusion

This SQL project provided valuable insights into customer behavior, financial metrics, and account activity. By analyzing different aspects of the bank customer data, we can:

- Tailor marketing campaigns and service enhancements for engaged customers.

- Allocate resources strategically based on geographical financial activity.

- Design tenure-specific incentives and promotions for credit card ownership.

- Develop age-specific product offerings and credit policies.

- Tailor engagement programs based on gender-specific account balance trends.
